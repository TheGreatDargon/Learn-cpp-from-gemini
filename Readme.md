# Learn CPP from Gemini

This is something I want to try, is to learn cpp from a generative AI. All code that I make will be in this github repo. I have some experience in C, Python, and Java, and I am looking at learning CPP. I initially was going to go with the traditional route by learning from [learncpp]("learncpp.com") which would probably be better, but I have also been interested in trying to learn something from a Generative AI model and to see how far it can take me.

The Gen AI, for now I am using google gemini, will try to teach me about a topic in cpp. It will try to present a challenge relating to that topic for me to code and test, then I will submit my code to it for it to review and critic.
